		<h3>Self Introduction</h3>
		<p> Good day, sir! I am Chenilain S. Lacap,  I am 19 years old, and I live in Quatis, Masiga, Gasan, Marinduque.  I am currently a second-year college student, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. My passions are basically helping people and exploring new things. And for my hobbies, I really enjoy watching K-dramas and dancing. </p>

		<h4>Background on Information Technology:</h4>
		<p> Information Technology, or IT for short, is all about using computers, networks, software, and digital tools to handle and work with information. It's been around for a while now and has changed a lot over the years, making a big impact on how businesses run, how people talk to each other, and how society does its thing. As a second-year college student, I faced a lot of challenges in this course, but I also learned a lot from these challenges. I know that this is not the end of my college journey, and I am excited and nervous at the same time about my third year college journey. I want to hone my skills and learn more deeply about the art of communication and technology, whether I know it is hard. But I am grateful to have the opportunity to learn something that I can use in the future. </p>
